## Vision

When you enter a well-run tech organization like Google, youâ€™re met with a suite of software tools that allow you to do things like :

- Optimize your diet at their cafeterias
- Find interns close to your desk
- Create a roadmap for your growth as a professional

These tools were created by Googlers for Googlers. UofT students could make use of tools made by other UofT students that would allow them to do things like:

- Suggest timetables that optimize for their preferred timings
- Generate calendar based on student's timetable and relavent events
- A platform that offers various club events

Fundamental problem we are trying to solve : 

The current process to choose your courses and manually create a schedule without any conflicts that fits your preferences can take days to perfect.
 
With the help of this tool, we are making this process much **faster** and **easier** than before. 

Futhermore, this will improve UofT's reputation since this tool will modernize a crucial part of a student's life.

## Implementation

### VIA Timetable
VIA Timetable is a module under VIA planner that aims to provide the best course selection experience. Unlike other tools such as Griddy or UTM Timetable, our users **do not** need to select the times for their courses, they simply need to search and click on their desired courses. With the combined power of our algorithm and comprehensive database of all 3 UofT campuses' courses, we are able to generate a conflict-free timetable.

You can learn more about it [here](/via-timetable/front-end)

### VIA Calendar
VIA Calendar is a module under VIA planner that serves as an extension of VIA Timetable. We envision the user being able to connect their google calendar and directly move their timetable from VIA Timetable into their calendar. Other features could be sharing your timetable with other VIA planner users.

### VIA Event

VIA Event is a module under VIA planner that aims to displays all events at UofT. We envision similar functionality to platforms such as Evenbrite where users could view, add, comment, and share different events.
